# Sports-Management-System
We are planning to build a team sports management software to be used by professional sports teams. This software will provide all the necessary tools for managing a professional team. We will provide a single interface at the start of the software where you pick a particular sport to enter into its own interface. We are planning to include two types of user: player and manager. The product line is designed to be very expandable. We only have very few mandatory features and many optional features. Hence, we can provide our software to a small club with a small budget, and to a big club with high budget and requirements. Also, as the clubs get used to our software they can opt for more and more features. Right now we are planning to build three variants of product from our product line: (i) Football Management System (ii) Basketball Management System (iii) Baseball Management System.
